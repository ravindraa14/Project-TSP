# Project-TSP
TSP- The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is defined as finding the shortest cyclic path that visits every node in a directed, edge-weighted graph exactly once, representing the challenge faced by a salesperson trying to visit multiple customers in different cities efficiently. I have done this simulation project with my team using turbo C++.
